# Learning Python Course
In this repo you can find several excercices done in the Lynda Course: "Learning Python". This has beginners excercises to learn the basics of python. This activities are not the same as the ones in the course, they are basic excercises I designed for myself based on the topics learned in each chapter of the course.
